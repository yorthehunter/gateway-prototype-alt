<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><a name="general"></a>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203317264"><strong>What is Stitch Fix?</strong></a></h2>
<p>Stitch Fix is the first fashion retailer to blend expert styling, proprietary technology and unique product to deliver a shopping experience that is truly personalized for you. Simply fill out the Stitch Fix Style Profile and our personal stylists will handpick a selection of five clothing items and accessories unique to your taste, budget and lifestyle. You can buy what you like and return the rest!&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203317264"><strong>How does it work?</strong></a></h3>
<p>1. Fill out your Style Profile</p>
<p>Begin by filling out the Style Profile. This helps us understand your size, style, shape, budget and lifestyle. Completing your profile should only take about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>2. Pick the date you’d like to receive your shipment</p>
<p>We’ll send you a selection of five clothing items and accessories handpicked by personal stylists on the date you choose. At the time your stylist selects your items, you will be charged a $20 styling fee. That $20 will be applied as a credit toward anything you keep from your shipment.</p>
<p>3. Try everything on in the comfort of your home</p>
<p>We encourage you to try on everything our personal stylists have picked for you because you just never know what will look great on! Create new outfits by pairing what’s in your shipment with the items that are already in your closet.</p>
<p>4. Buy what you like and return the rest</p>
<ul>
<li>Take three days to decide what you’ll purchase and what you’d like to send back. You’re only charged for these items when you tell us what you’re keeping and returning.</li>
<li>Check out by logging in to your <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.stitchfix.com/account">account</a> to pay for those items you want to keep. The $20 styling fee will be applied as credit towards any items you purchase. If you buy all five items, we’ll give you 25% off the entire purchase!</li>
<li>Simply return the items you don't want in our pre-paid mailing bag and drop it at any USPS mailbox. Stitch Fix clients enjoy free shipping both ways as a benefit of using our service!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Tell us what you think!</p>
<p>Don't forget to give us specific feedback on each of the items you receive. Our personal stylists are able to send you better selections when we know what did and didn’t work for you, and why. <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="http://blog.stitchfix.com/leaving-fix-feedback/">Our blog</a> offers a number of tips on the best ways to communicate with your personal stylist.</p>
<p>If you choose to receive regularly scheduled shipments, we will automatically schedule the delivery date for your next shipment. You can always choose an alternative date that better suits your needs or opt out of regularly scheduled shipments entirely.<br>Stitch Fix does not require a membership fee or a monthly subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203317264"><strong>How is Stitch Fix different than shopping online, or in a store?</strong></a></h3>
<p>The Stitch Fix experience is not merely curated, it’s truly personalized to your taste, budget and lifestyle. Personal stylists handpick a selection of five items just for you. In fact, no two clients have ever received the same selection of items!</p>
<p>Stitch Fix makes shopping not just convenient, but effortless. Like other online retailers, Stitch Fix saves you a trip to the store by shipping items directly to you. But our personal stylists also save you the time and trouble of selecting clothing and accessories. Many of our clients enjoy the ease and convenience of automatically scheduled shipments that arrive at a frequency of their choosing.</p>
<p>At Stitch Fix, our dressing room is your home. We encourage you to try everything on in the comfort of your home and see how the items we send work with what’s already in your closet.</p>
<p>Returns are easy at Stitch Fix. Simply slip the items you’re returning into the prepaid mailing envelope and drop it into any USPS mailbox. Shipping is always free at Stitch Fix!&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484460"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our average price point is $55 per item, but we carry a wide variety of price points. When you fill out the Style Profile, you tell us how much you are comfortable paying. We do our best to pick items that reflect those preferences. If you choose to buy all 5 pieces, you get a 25% discount off of your entire purchase!&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202595560/Price_Preferences.png" alt="" width="407" height="289"></p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484470"><strong>What types of items might you send me?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Because our clients’ tastes are varied we carry a wide range of items. We currently offer pants, skirts, shorts, dresses, sweaters, shirts, outerwear, scarves, jewelry and bags. We’re growing and evolving quickly and you can expect to see us add more and more new categories and brands.</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484470"><strong>What brands can I expect?</strong></a></h3>
<p>We work with over 200 of the best up-and-coming labels and brands — the kinds featured in magazines and on stylish celebs. For example, your shipment might feature clothing by Collective Concepts, Kut From The Kloth, Daniel Rainn, Kensie, L.A. Made, Sanctuary, Mystree or Tart. Part of the fun of Stitch Fix is that we will introduce you to new brands that bring diversity and freshness to your wardrobe!</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203485130"><strong>What ages can you style?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Each shipment is completely customized to suit your individual preferences and needs. &nbsp;We carry a wide range of inventory that allows us to choose pieces that will be perfect for your personal style, regardless of your age.<strong><strong><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203485130"><strong>What sizes can you style?</strong></a></h3>
<p>We are currently able to style women who wear sizes 0/XS–14/XL, which reflects the size offering currently available to us from the brands we carry. We are actively working with our brands to increase the range of sizes so that we can deliver great selections to more women.</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203485130"><strong>Do you style for men?</strong></a></h3>
<p>We are currently exploring a men’s line with a small number of beta clients. A more extensive men’s offering is planned for fall 2016. For those interested in learning more about Stitch Fix Men as details become available, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://stitchfix.com/mens" target="_blank">stitchfix.com/mens</a> and join the waiting list for Stitch Fix Men.</p>

<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><a name="profile"></a>STYLE PROFILE</h2>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/204732770"><strong>How do I find my size?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Please use the size guide we have provided to provide us with your size. Because we constantly validate sizing to ensure consistency among the many brands we carry, we may choose to ship you a different size than what you have included in your Style Profile. Don’t worry about the size on the tag, we are just making sure we are sending you the items that will fit you best!</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203822174"><strong>Do you offer petite sizing?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Yes! We are very excited to offer petite sizes to our clients! We now offer petite along with our regular selection of inventory.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203822174"><strong>What is the difference between your regular inventory and petite sizes?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our petite selection offers our clients access to inventory with shorter sleeves, narrower shoulders, and shorter hems and inseams—all to fit you better!</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/204166320"><strong>Do you offer maternity items?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Yes! Just let your Stylist know that you would like to receive maternity clothing by <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/style">updating your Style Profile</a>&nbsp;with your due date. By letting us know when you are due, your Stylist will be able to send you the right pieces at the right time.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202335994/Maternity_on_FAQ.png" alt=""></p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/204166320"><strong>Can you style me throughout my pregnancy?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Yes! We can style around your bump through all three trimesters and even post-baby. Let us know your due date and your Stylist can take it from there.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484520"><strong>Can I request specific pieces?</strong></a></h3>
<p>You can leave a note for your stylist whenever you schedule a shipment. Once your shipment is scheduled, you can view, edit, or add to the note directly on your Stitch Fix homepage.&nbsp;We recommend giving your personal stylist an idea of what types of pieces you are looking for rather than exact pieces so that she can choose new items you will love. For example, instead of a specific blouse, please let her know you’d love a drapey, colorful blouse and then she can choose the best piece for you from our current inventory. If you request a specific item we’ll do our best to find it for you, but sometimes these requests are out of stock.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202368100/Make_a_request_for_your_shipment_for_FAQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><a name="billing"></a>BILLING</h2>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484940"><strong>When will my credit card be charged?</strong></a></h3>
<p>When you enter your credit card information upon completing our Style Profile, your credit card will not be charged. Each time you choose to order a shipment, a $20 styling fee will be charged after your personal stylist begins styling for you. That styling fee will be credited towards anything you purchase in that shipment.</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484940"><strong>Does the style fee roll over if I decide not to keep anything?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Your styling fee can only be applied to the purchase of anything in your <em>current</em> Fix. It does not roll over to your next shipment and cannot be refunded. Most of our clients fall in love with at least one item in each shipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">^Top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><a name="scheduling"></a>SCHEDULING</h2>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203317734"><strong>How does the subscription work?</strong></a></h3>
<p>You can elect to receive shipments at a frequency that’s right for you - every 2-3 weeks, every month, or every other month. If a subscription is not the best option for you, we also offer you the ability to manually schedule a shipment when it is convenient for you.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202335804/Shipment_Frequency.png" alt=""></p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203317734"><strong>Do I have to sign up for automatic shipments?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Not unless you want to! We think regularly scheduled shipments are a truly effortless way to keep your style fresh. You can elect to receive shipments at a frequency that’s right for you—every 2-3 weeks, every month, every other month or quarterly.</p>
<p>We want you to choose the solution that works best for you, whether that means shipments arrive automatically or you place an order manually each time. Stitch Fix does does not require a membership fee or a monthly subscription.</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203317734"><strong>How do I change or cancel my subscription?</strong></a></h3>
<p>You can still sign up for a subscription if you already have a shipment scheduled. From your homepage, click on “Sign up for automatic Fixes.” This will not change the date of your current shipment.</p>
<p>If you want to skip your next shipment, you don’t need to change your subscription. From your homepage, click on “Skip this Fix.” When you select this option, we won’t send your next scheduled shipment, but your subscription will resume as usual for the following shipment. If we’re already working on your next shipment, this option won’t appear on your homepage and you’ll need to <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=21500">contact us</a>&nbsp;to check if there is still time to cancel your next shipment.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">To cancel your subscription, click on “Manage automatic Fixes” on your homepage. When you cancel your automatic shipments you can also select to cancel your upcoming shipment. If you don’t cancel your next shipment, it will still arrive on the requested date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">^Top</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><a name="returns"></a>RETURNS</h2>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484970"><strong>How do returns work?</strong></a></h3>
<p>A return envelope with a pre-paid shipping label is included in each package. Returns may be dropped off in any USPS drop box or post office.</p>
<h3><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/203484970"><strong>How long do I have to send back the items I don’t want to keep?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Returns are due back in the mail three days after you receive the package (for example, if your shipment arrives on Monday, we ask that you drop your returns in the mail by that Thursday.) If the third day falls on a Sunday or holiday, please drop your return envelope in the mail the following business day. Please let us know if you don’t get your package on time or if the post office has lost your package by <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25724">contacting us</a>&nbsp;and we will make an exception on your return date. If your return has not been postmarked within three days of receipt, we will assume you are keeping all five items and charge your credit card for the entire shipment. We can't accept additional returns after your initial return is sent. Please make sure you try everything on before you drop your package in the mail.</p>
